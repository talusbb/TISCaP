⎛             ⎞
⎜ Quick Start ⎟
⎝             ⎠


Launch the Tischat Client.app alias inside the Tischat Client folder.

If this has come unlinked in the shuffle, launch it from
    DerivedData/Tischat Client/Build/Products/Debug/
    
Enter a server address and username, and click Log In.

The main pane of the main window is the public messaging arena.
Write a message and press return to publish it.

The sidebar lists the logged-in users. Select one and hit the “Chat”
button to begin a private conversation with them. If they begin one
with you first, a window with their message will pop up.

⎜ File Structure ⎟
⎝                ⎠


Tischat Client.xcodeproj
    is the Cocoa Xcode project for this client.
    You can browse the source from within Xcode, which provides responsive
    highlighting and more structure than the directories do.
    
    If you want to build from this project, you'll need to tell Xcode
    not to try and code sign using my certificate.
    
    Within the Xcode project:
    
    Library
        Supporting data structures for the mechanics of the protocol.
        
        TiscapTransmission (.h/.m)
            The direct correlary to TiscapTransmission in the server.
        
        MessageDispatch (.h/.m)
            Coördinates all interactions with the server.
        
        ActiveUser (.h/.m)
            Represents a logged-in user in the chat circle.
        
        MessageList (.h/.m)
            A model/controller holding a list of messages to display.
    
    
    Application
        The controllers for the application logic.
        
        PrivateConversation (.h/.m/.xib)
            An NSDocument subclass displaying a private conversation.
            The nib contains the interface for the private conversations.
        
        AppController (.h/.m/.xib)
            Coördinates all application-level business,
            including login and the main window.
        
        MainMenu.xib
            This nib contains the interface for the main window and menubar.
            It instantiates the AppController.
    
    
    3rd Party Awesomeness
        See the references in the respective header files.
        
        GCDAsyncSocket (.h/.m)
            Public Domain; Created by Robbie Hanson, among others.
            Fills in all the missing objectivity for Cocoa sockets.
            TCP-specific, powered by Grand Central Dispatch.
            
            Only slightly harder to use than Java or Ruby sockets,
            but provides much, much more customizability and hooks,
            and takes care of all the crabby details.
        
        MiddleAlignedTextFieldCell (.h/.m)
            Provides a text field cell (for table views)
            where the text is aligned to the middle.
            
            Given as an answer on StackOverflow.
    
    
    Images.xcassets
        I really have no idea what this is doing here.
    
    
    Supporting Files
        Irrelevant to this project.
    
    


Tischat Client folder
    Contains all the above source files,
    just not arranged in any particular way.




Alias to Tischat Client.app
    The built, ready-to-run application.
    (Linked for Mac OS X 10.8 and later.)



DerivedData folder
    Contains build information.

⎜ Necessary Improvements ⎟
⎝                        ⎠

    
The interface is not very polished. It allows for some illegal operations,
though they're not too serious.
